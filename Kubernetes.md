 I want to share about Kubernetes, How a large number of containers are operated, created, and managed? How develops & owns Kubernetes with benefits of it.



Orchestration of Containers

    Kubernetes is an orchestrator. More specifically, it’s an orchestrator of containerized apps. This means it helps us deploy and maintain applications that are distributed and deployed as containers.

What is Kubernetes ??



    Kubernetes is a production-grade, OpenSource platform that orchestrates containers for application deployment, scaling, and management of applications within and across computer clusters (or Cloud.)

    It was originally designed by Google and it was open-sourced and handed over to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the summer of 2014.  Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

How to read Kubernetes?

    It is Greek for a pilot or helmsman (the person holding the ship’s steering wheel). People pronounce Kubernetes in a few different ways.

    Many pronounce it as Koo-ber-nay-tace, while others pronounce it more like Koo-ber-netties. You can simply call it K8s

How much Kubernetes is being used 

    Google has been running containerized workloads in production for more than a decade. Whether it’s service jobs like web front-ends and stateful servers, infrastructure systems, virtually everything at Google runs as a container. 



Approx two Billion (yes 2Billion ) containers run at Google per week! 


Kubernetes Benefits

    Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application

Service discovery and load balancing 

Storage orchestration 

Automated rollouts and rollbacks 

Automatic bin packing 

Self-healing 

Secret and configuration management

Conclusion

    With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to be released and updated in an easy and fast way without downtime.




It is not the end but it is a beginning. Sharing more about Kubernetes in the next article.
