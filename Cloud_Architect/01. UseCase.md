### Start the HTTP service on each ECS under ELB

```shell
nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8889 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
curl 127.0.0.1:8889
touch SERVER1 
```
 this command starts a simple HTTP server in the background on port 8889, ignoring any output (both standard output and error), and ensures that it continues running even if the user logs out.
