### Start the HTTP service on each ECS under ELB

**For Python2.7**
```shell
nohup python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8889 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
curl 127.0.0.1:8889
touch SERVER1 
```
 this command starts a simple HTTP server in the background on port 8889, ignoring any output (both standard output and error), and ensures that it continues running even if the user logs out.

**For Python3**
```shell
nohup python3 -m http.server 8889 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
curl 127.0.0.1:8889
touch SERVER1 
```
 If you're using Python 3, the equivalent command would be python3 -m http.server 8889 instead, since SimpleHTTPServer has been merged into http.server in Python 3.
