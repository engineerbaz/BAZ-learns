### Convince Client
- Focus on Business Outcomes: 
  - Understand Business objectives, not just IT needs.
  - Translate technical benefits into tangible Business outcomes like increased agility, reduced T2M and Improved Customer experience
- Address Pain Point
  - Address current challenges(cost, scalability, Security issues)
- Build trust by proof
  - Use Case studies
  - POCs and demo.
- Cost Optimization
  - Provide TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
  - operational efficiencies
- Emphasize Security and Compliance
  - explain robust Security measure
  - compliance certifiatcion by CSP
- Innvoation 
  - Enable innovation for AI, ML and serverless
- Provide Roadmap
  - Develop and share clear migration roadmap with steps, timelines and support available 

### Gather Information from Client
- Discovery Workshop
  - Conduct in-depth workshop with key stakeholders to understand Business process, IT infra, and future goal.
- Technical Assesments
  - Perform detailed Technical Assesmentsof existing infrastructure, application and data to identify dependencies and migration challenges.
- Questionnaires & Suervey
  - Gather Information by questionnaires & Suervey
- Documents Review
  - Review exisiting Documents like Network diagram, app architecure and policies.
Importantly, pay attention to client concerns and questions to understand their needs

==============
ISO/IEC 27017 is a security standard developed for cloud service providers and users to make a safer cloud-based environment and reduce the risk of security problems.[1] It was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) under the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27
This International Standard provides guidelines supporting the implementation of information security controls for cloud service customers, who implements the controls, and cloud service providers to support the implementations of those controls
