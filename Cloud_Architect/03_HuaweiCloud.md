## Compute
ECS are Virtual machines on cloud, where BMS (Bare Metal Server) are dedicated server in cloud


## BMS 
BMS are good for dedicated tasks. 

1. VPC Interface (for connectivity within VPC [logical connection])
2. High Speed Network (internal network, east wast traffic, layer2 only, Doesnt support EIP, SG, VPNs. DNS, Direct Connect)
3. Enhance High Speed Network (High quality, speed and low latency for internal network for BMS each other communicate each other )
4. User Defined VLAN ()
5. InfiiniBrand (For HPC project, low latency and high Bandwidth - Works between servers for duplication, replication)
