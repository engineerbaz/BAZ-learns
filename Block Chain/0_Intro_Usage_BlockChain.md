# Block Chain
Fundamentally, BlockChain is a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network so in simple words “BlockChain provides a mechanism / system of recording information so it cannot be hacked, or changed”.

##  Working

A blockchain is a decentralized & distributed architecture. All records that are linked together in form of BLOCK using cryptography contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

- Every transaction is recorded as soon as it occurs in a “block” of data
- Each block is connected to the ones before and after it
- Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain


## Use Cases
Blockchain technology can is being used into multiple areas, Some of common use cases are

- Cryptocurrencies
