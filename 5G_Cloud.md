## **5G & MEC - A perfect combo!**



## 5G needs MEC
5G helps service innovations toward enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications(mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). 
 
Cloud-powered AR/VR, cloud-based gaming, UAV applications, HD live broadcast, and industrial control & IoV are some applications need lower latency, roaming at the edge, and exposure of subscriber location information for real-time service optimization.

To satisfy new service requirements, MEC comes into play and offers a future-oriented architecture.

## MEC Standardization

International Telecommunication Union's Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) defines three significant areas of usage and applications as part of its 5G initiative:

- Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB): Cater to the growing demand for ubiquitous broadband connectivity with enhanced data rates, connection density, and mobility.
- Massive Internet of things (mMTC): Connectivity for millions of devices transmitting sensitive data. Availability of low-cost devices with long battery lives.
- Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Services (URLLC): Reliable connectivity with stringent requirements on latency and throughput.
 
It also defined 5G network capability requirements for throughput, latency, connection density, and spectral efficiency improvement.


    **MEC to meet the requirements of 5G services for low-latency, localization and big calculation**
## MEC

Multi-access edge computing is proposed by the ETSI & 3GPP. It is an open platform that integrates network, computing, storage, and application core capabilities near the network edge of objects or data sources. Smart interconnection services are provided nearby to meet the industry's key requirements for real-time services, service intelligence, data aggregation and interoperability, security and privacy protection during the digital transformation process.


Carriers may deliver apps, content, and a portion of core network functions (including service logic and resource orchestration) to the edge of access networks using the MEC system. These nodes, as opposed to traditional central DCs, are placed closer to subscribers and can provide greater dependability and service experience.

### MEC Sub division
MEC can be sub-divided into three parts 

#### 1. Multi-access: 
MEC was previously named mobile edge computing. Later the ETSI MEC group replaced "mobile" with "multi-access". 
Firstly referring to various network access modes, such as LTE, WiFi, wired, and even ZigBee, LoRa, NB-IOT and other Internet of things application scenarios.
Secondly this "multi-access" feature enables an MEC system to provide consistent experience to users connecting through any access technologies.

#### Edge: 
Network functions and applications are deployed at the edge of the network, as close to the end user as possible, reducing transmission delays & delivering ultra-low latency.

#### Computing 
Refers to Cloud + Fog computing, which adopts computing technology to reduce the construction and O&M cost of large-scale distributed network.
Such capabilities include video coding and decoding, VR/AR rendering, video analysis, and AI.
Local video surveillance for security and traffic management is one of a common use. Surveillance video backhauling takes a lot of bandwidth, although much of the footage is static or of a little use. MEC enables local analysis and processing of video streams, with just the relevant data being backhaulled. 
Insignificant data will be retained locally for a short time before being destroyed.
