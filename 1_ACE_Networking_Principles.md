# Aviatrix Certified Engineer - Multi-Cloud Network Associate Course

## Networking Principles in Cloud

In network world, all 
- deployment is slow in On-prem 
- Initially Networking is only available on physical NEs
- Then Virtualization came into place, where multiple Guest NEs can work on a single hardware using Virtualization sofwares like (VMware) under name of Private Cloud
- This Virtualization has many benefits but some key issues comes with it.
- All Infrastructure started moving to Public cloud 
- In Public cloud, there is no customer access and an architectural gap for BASIC Cloud Networking elements, which was ful filled by Aviatrix

## IasS, PaaS, SaaS
- IasS > You scale, make resillient and manage
- PasS >> You Manage only Data & Application | Scale, resillient & Management by CSP
- SaaS >>> Scale, resillience and Management by CSP

## Cloud deployment
- Public cloud are shared resources, multiple Clients
- Private Cloud is single Client at organization DC, higgly Secured
- Hybrid Cloud is combination of both

## Public Cloud Basics
- DataCenter > Where you housed your network NEs
- REGION >> DC grouped in Regions & geographic areas 
- Availability Zone >>> Distinct locations with CSP's network engineered to avoid failures

#### Azure Region
- 54 Regions 
- 130K+ Fiber 
- 160+ Edge locations
- 500+ Network Partners
- 20K+ peering connections

### Availability Zone 
- Provide inexpensive , low latency network connectivity to other AZ in same Regions


### Public Cloud Network VS On-Prem DataCenter
- Networking elements are same but their locations changed 
- In public cloud, no layers , NEs are flat (side by side, condensed)
- All NEs like Router, Switch, Firewall, VPN, NAT
