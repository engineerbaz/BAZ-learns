### Manual Schedulling 
Assigining pod manually to a specific node using `nodename` in descriptive mode. 

`kubectl replace` command use to delete old and create new one. Syntax is `kubectl replace --force -f <filename>`

### Labels & Selectors
Labels are being used to classified and selecting resources (for Service, ReplicaSet)


`kubectl get pod --selector key=value --no-headers | wc -l` for getting number pods with a specific Label using command wc -l 
`kubectl get pod --show-labels`


### Taints and Tolerations


- Taints on node
- Tolerations on pod

`kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:taint-effect`

- NoSchedule
- PrefereNoSchedule
- NoExecute

Taint is already set to Master Node so no workload to be Schedulled on master node


## Node Selectors

By using labels on Node, we can suggest pod to be Schedulled on desired node. But there is a challenge associated, only single value can be be selected based on .

## Node Affinity
Ensure Pod is hosted on desired host, other then NodeSelector, it has feature to apply multiple key/value options 
There are multiple operators 
- Exists
- In  
- NotIn 


```
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: size
          operator: NotIn
          values:
          - Small
          - Mid 
```
required
|---|DuringScheduling | DuringExecution |
|Type 1 |Required  | Ignored |
|Type 2 |Preffered | Ignored |
|Type 3 |Required | Required |
|Type 4 |Preffered | Required |
