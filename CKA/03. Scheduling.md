Assigining pod manually to a specific node using `nodename` in descriptive mode. 

`kubectl replace` command use to delete old and create new one. Syntax is `kubectl replace --force -f <filename>`

Labels are being used to classified and selecting resources (for Service, ReplicaSet)


`kubectl get pod --selector key=value --no-headers | wc -l` for getting number pods with a specific Label using command wc -l 
`kubectl get pod --show-labels`


### Taints and Tolerations


- Taints on node
- Tolerations on pod

`kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:taint-effect`

- NoSchedule
- PrefereNoSchedule
- NoExecute

Taint is already set to Master Node so no workload to be Schedulled on master node
