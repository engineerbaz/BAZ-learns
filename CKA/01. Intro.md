# Core Concept Kubernetes






CRI (Container Runtime Interface) follows OCI (Open Container Initiative) that has 
- Imagespec
- runtimespec

Rocket and other follows OCI and Docker dont. So Docker Shim used for it.

Docker is not only runtime but has many options like CLI, API , VOlume etc

ContainerD is CRI compatible and can works as seprate runtime

In Kubernetes v1.24 remove Docker

## ContainerD

ContainerD is also CNCF approved runtime, ContainerD comes with tool ``ctr`` tool for debugging Containers only. not very friendly 

``ctr image pull redis`` 

Better alternative is ``nerdctl`` for providing Docker like CLI 

``nerdctl run -d --image redis``

## crictl

**crictl** provides a CLI fo CRI compatible containers. It is used to inspect and debug container runtime

``crictl pull busybox`` and ``crictl exec -ti tyuyuyi ls`` some examples

``crictl pods`` works as well 

// crictl --runtime-endpoints

ContainerD - ctr and nerdctl 
Kubernetes - crictl
